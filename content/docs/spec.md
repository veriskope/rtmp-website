## Abstract

This memo describes Adobe’s Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP), an application-level protocol designed for multiplexing and packetizing multimedia transport streams (such as audio, video, and interactive content) over a suitable transport protocol (such as TCP).

## Status of this document

This is a machine-readable version of the December 21, 2012 "Adobe’s Real Time Messaging Protocol" spec, which was [originally published as a PDF](../../pdf/rtmp_specification_1.0.pdf). There have been no substantive changes to the spec from the 2012 PDF as of this HTML publication in January 2019. The only changes are in format and copyedits.


## 1. Introduction

Adobe’s Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) provides a bidirectional message multiplex service over a reliable stream transport, such as TCP [RFC0793], intended to carry parallel streams of video, audio, and data messages, with associated timing information, between a pair of communicating peers. Implementations typically assign different priorities to different classes of messages, which can affect the order in which messages are enqueued to the underlying stream transport when transport capacity is constrained.

This memo describes the syntax and operation of the Real Time Messaging Protocol.


### 1.1. Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this memo are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

## 3. Definitions

**Payload**: The data contained in a packet, for example audio samples or compressed video data. The payload format and interpretation are beyond the scope of this document.

**Packet**: A data packet consists of fixed header and payload data. Some underlying protocols may require an encapsulation of the packet to be defined.

**Port**: The "abstraction that transport protocols use to distinguish among multiple destinations within a given host computer. TCP/IP protocols identify ports using small positive integers." The transport selectors (TSEL) used by the OSI transport layer are equivalent to ports.

**Transport address**: The combination of a network address and port that identifies a transport-level endpoint, for example an IP address and a TCP port. Packets are transmitted from a source transport address to a destination transport address.

**Message stream**: A logical channel of communication in which messages flow.

**Message stream ID**: Each message has an ID associated with it to identify the message stream in which it is flowing.

**Chunk**: A fragment of a message. The messages are broken into smaller parts and interleaved before they are sent over the network. The chunks ensure timestamp-ordered end-to-end delivery of all messages, across multiple streams.

**Chunk stream**: A logical channel of communication that allows flow of chunks in a particular direction. The chunk stream can travel from the client to the server and reverse.

**Chunk stream ID**: Every chunk has an ID associated with it to identify the chunk stream in which it is flowing.

**Multiplexing**: Process of making separate audio/video data into one coherent audio/video stream, making it possible to transmit several video and audio simultaneously.

**DeMultiplexing**: Reverse process of multiplexing, in which interleaved audio and video data are assembled to form the original audio and video data.

**Remote Procedure Call (RPC)**: A request that allows a client or a server to call a subroutine or procedure at the peer end.

**Metadata**: A description about the data. The metadata of a movie includes the movie title, duration, date of creation, and so on.

**Application Instance**: The instance of the application at the server with which the clients connect by sending the connect request.

**Action Message Format (AMF)**: A compact binary format that is used to serialize ActionScript object graphs. AMF has two versions: AMF 0 [AMF0] and AMF 3 [AMF3].

## 4. Byte Order, Alignment, and Time Format

All integer fields are carried in network byte order, byte zero is the first byte shown, and bit zero is the most significant bit in a word or field. This byte order is commonly known as big-endian. The transmission order is described in detail in Internet Protocol [RFC0791]. Unless otherwise noted, numeric constants in this document are in decimal (base 10).

Except as otherwise specified, all data in RTMP is byte-aligned; for example, a 16-bit field may be at an odd byte offset. Where padding is indicated, padding bytes SHOULD have the value zero.

Timestamps in RTMP are given as an integer number of milliseconds relative to an unspecified epoch. Typically, each stream will start with a timestamp of 0, but this is not required, as long as the two endpoints agree on the epoch. Note that this means that any synchronization across multiple streams (especially from separate hosts) requires some additional mechanism outside of RTMP.

Because timestamps are 32 bits long, they roll over every 49 days, 17 hours, 2 minutes and 47.296 seconds. Because streams are allowed to run continuously, potentially for years on end, an RTMP application SHOULD use serial number arithmetic [RFC1982] when processing timestamps, and SHOULD be capable of handling wraparound. For example, an application assumes that all adjacent timestamps are within 2^31 - 1 milliseconds of each other, so 10000 comes after 4000000000, and 3000000000 comes before 4000000000.

Timestamp deltas are also specified as an unsigned integer number of milliseconds, relative to the previous timestamp. Timestamp deltas may be either 24 or 32 bits long.


## 5. RTMP Chunk Stream

This section specifies the Real Time Messaging Protocol Chunk Stream (RTMP Chunk Stream). It provides multiplexing and packetizing services for a higher-level multimedia stream protocol.

While RTMP Chunk Stream was designed to work with the Real Time Messaging Protocol (Section 6), it can handle any protocol that sends a stream of messages. Each message contains timestamp and payload type identification. RTMP Chunk Stream and RTMP together are suitable for a wide variety of audio-video applications, from one-to-one and one-to-many live broadcasting to video-on-demand services to interactive conferencing applications.

When used with a reliable transport protocol such as TCP [RFC0793], RTMP Chunk Stream provides guaranteed timestamp-ordered end-to-end delivery of all messages, across multiple streams. RTMP Chunk Stream does not provide any prioritization or similar forms of control, but can be used by higher-level protocols to provide such prioritization. For example, a live video server might choose to drop video messages for a slow client to ensure that audio messages are received in a timely fashion, based on either the time to send or the time to acknowledge each message.

RTMP Chunk Stream includes its own in-band protocol control messages, and also offers a mechanism for the higher-level protocol to embed user control messages.


### 5.1.	Message Format

The format of a message that can be split into chunks to support multiplexing depends on a higher level protocol. The message format SHOULD however contain the following fields which are necessary for creating the chunks.

**Timestamp**: Timestamp of the message. This field can transport 4 bytes.

**Length**: Length of the message payload. If the message header cannot be elided, it should be included in the length. This field occupies 3 bytes in the chunk header.

**Type Id**: A range of type IDs are reserved for protocol control messages. These messages which propagate information are handled by both RTMP Chunk Stream protocol and the higher-level protocol. All other type IDs are available for use by the higher-level protocol, and treated as opaque values by RTMP Chunk Stream. In fact, nothing in RTMP Chunk Stream requires these values to be used as a type; all (non-protocol) messages could be of the same type, or the application could use this field to distinguish simultaneous tracks rather than types. This field occupies 1 byte in the chunk header.

**Message Stream ID**: The message stream ID can be any arbitrary value. Different message streams multiplexed onto the same chunk stream are demultiplexed based on their message stream IDs. Beyond that, as far as RTMP Chunk Stream is concerned, this is an opaque value. This field occupies 4 bytes in the chunk header in little endian format.


### 5.2.	Handshake

An RTMP connection begins with a handshake. The handshake is unlike the rest of the protocol; it consists of three static-sized chunks rather than consisting of variable-sized chunks with headers.

The client (the endpoint that has initiated the connection) and the server each send the same three chunks. For exposition, these chunks will be designated C0, C1, and C2 when sent by the client; S0, S1, and S2 when sent by the server.


#### 5.2.1.	Handshake Sequence

The handshake begins with the client sending the C0 and C1 chunks.

The client MUST wait until S1 has been received before sending C2. The client MUST wait until S2 has been received before sending any other data.

The server MUST wait until C0 has been received before sending S0 and S1, and MAY wait until after C1 as well. The server MUST wait until C1 has been received before sending S2. The server MUST wait until C2 has been received before sending any other data.


#### 5.2.2.	C0 and S0 Format

The C0 and S0 packets are a single octet, treated as a single 8-bit integer field:

<figure><pre>
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|    version    |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</pre>
<figcaption>C0 and S0 bits</figcaption>
</figure>


Following are the fields in the C0/S0 packets:

**Version (8 bits)**: In C0, this field identifies the RTMP version requested by the client. In S0, this field identifies the RTMP version selected by the server. The version defined by this specification is 3. Values 0-2 are deprecated values used by earlier proprietary products; 4-31 are reserved for future implementations; and 32-255 are not allowed (to allow distinguishing RTMP from text-based protocols, which always start with a printable character). A server that does not recognize the client’s requested version SHOULD respond with 3. The client MAY choose to degrade to version 3, or to abandon the handshake.


#### 5.2.3.	C1 and S1 Format

The C1 and S1 packets are 1536 octets long, consisting of the following fields:

<figure><pre>
 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                        time (4 bytes)                         |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                        zero (4 bytes)                         |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                         random bytes                          |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                         random bytes                          |
|                           (cont)                              |
|                             ...                               |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</pre>
<figcaption>C1 and S1 bits</figcaption>
</figure>

**Time (4 bytes)**: This field contains a timestamp, which SHOULD be used as the epoch for all future chunks sent from this endpoint. This may be 0, or some arbitrary value. To synchronize multiple chunkstreams, the endpoint may wish to send the current value of the other chunkstream’s timestamp.

**Zero (4 bytes)**: This field MUST be all 0s.

**Random data (1528 bytes)**: This field can contain any arbitrary values. Since each endpoint has to distinguish between the response to the handshake it has initiated and the handshake initiated by its peer,this data SHOULD send something sufficiently random. But there is no need for cryptographically-secure randomness, or even dynamic values.


#### 5.2.4. C2 and S2 Format

The C2 and S2 packets are 1536 octets long, and nearly an echo of S1 and C1 (respectively), consisting of the following fields:

<figure><pre>
 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                        time2 (4 bytes)                        |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                          random echo                          |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                          random echo                          |
|                            (cont)                             |
|                              ...                              |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</pre>
<figcaption>C2 and S2 bits</figcaption>
</figure>

**Time (4 bytes)**: This field MUST contain the timestamp sent by the peer in S1 (for C2) or C1 (for S2).

**Time2 (4 bytes)**: This field MUST contain the timestamp at which the previous packet(s1 or c1) sent by the peer was read.

**Random echo (1528 bytes)**: This field MUST contain the random data field sent by the peer in S1 (for C2) or S2 (for C1). Either peer can use the time and time2 fields together with the current timestamp as a quick estimate of the bandwidth and/or latency of the connection, but this is unlikely to be useful.

The following describes the states mentioned in the handshake diagram:

**Uninitialized**: The protocol version is sent during this stage. Both the client and server are uninitialized. The The client sends the protocol version in packet C0. If the server supports the version, it sends S0 and S1 in response. If not, the server responds by taking the appropriate action. In RTMP, this action is terminating the connection.

**Version Sent**: Both client and server are in the Version Sent state after the Uninitialized state. The client is waiting for the packet S1 and the server is waiting for the packet C1. On receiving the awaited packets, the client sends the packet C2 and the server sends the packet S2. The state then becomes Ack Sent.

**Ack Sent**: The client and the server wait for S2 and C2 respectively.

**Handshake Done**: The client and the server exchange messages.


### 5.3.	Chunking

After handshaking, the connection multiplexes one or more chunk streams. Each chunk stream carries messages of one type from one message stream. Each chunk that is created has a unique ID associated with it called chunk stream ID. The chunks are transmitted over the network. While transmitting, each chunk must be sent in full before the next chunk. At the receiver end, the chunks are assembled into messages based on the chunk stream ID.

Chunking allows large messages at the higher-level protocol to be broken into smaller messages, for example to prevent large low-priority messages (such as video) from blocking smaller high-priority messages (such as audio or control).

Chunking also allows small messages to be sent with less overhead, as the chunk header contains a compressed representation of information that would otherwise have to be included in the message itself.

The chunk size is configurable. It can be set using a Set Chunk Size control message (Section 5.4.1). Larger chunk sizes reduce CPU usage, but also commit to larger writes that can delay other content on lower bandwidth connections. Smaller chunks are not good for high bit rate streaming. Chunk size is maintained independently for each direction.


#### 5.3.1.	Chunk Format


Each chunk consists of a header and data. The header itself has three parts:

<figure><pre>
+--------------+----------------+--------------------+--------------+
| Basic Header | Message Header | Extended Timestamp |  Chunk Data  |
+--------------+----------------+--------------------+--------------+
|                                                    |
|<------------------- Chunk Header ----------------->|
</pre>
<figcaption>Chunk Format</figcaption>
</figure>

**Basic Header (1 to 3 bytes)**: This field encodes the chunk stream ID and the chunk type. Chunk type determines the format of the encoded message header. The length depends entirely on the chunk stream ID, which is a variable-length field.

**Message Header (0, 3, 7, or 11 bytes)**: This field encodes information about the message being sent (whether in whole or in part). The length can be determined using the chunk type specified in the chunk header.

**Extended Timestamp (0 or 4 bytes)**: This field is present in certain circumstances depending on the encoded timestamp or timestamp delta field in the Chunk Message header. See Section 5.3.1.3 for more information.

**Chunk Data (variable size)**: The payload of this chunk, up to the configured maximum chunk size.


##### 5.3.1.1. Chunk Basic Header

The Chunk Basic Header encodes the chunk stream ID and the chunk type (represented by fmt field in the figure below). Chunk type determines the format of the encoded message header. Chunk Basic Header field may be 1, 2, or 3 bytes, depending on the chunk stream ID.

An implementation SHOULD use the smallest representation that can hold the ID.

The protocol supports up to 65597 streams with IDs 3-65599. The IDs 0, 1, and 2 are reserved. Value 0 indicates the 2 byte form and an ID in the range of 64-319 (the second byte + 64). Value 1 indicates the 3 byte form and an ID in the range of 64-65599 ((the third byte)\*256 + the second byte + 64). Values in the range of 3-63 represent the complete stream ID. Chunk Stream ID with value 2 is reserved for low-level protocol control messages and commands.

The bits 0-5 (least significant) in the chunk basic header represent the chunk stream ID.

Chunk stream IDs 2-63 can be encoded in the 1-byte version of this field.

<figure><pre>
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|fmt|   cs id   |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</pre>
<figcaption>Chunk basic header 1</figcaption>
</figure>

Chunk stream IDs 64-319 can be encoded in the 2-byte form of the header. ID is computed as (the second byte + 64).

<figure><pre>
 0                   1
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|fmt|     0     |   cs id - 64  |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</pre>
<figcaption>Chunk basic header 2</figcaption>
</figure>

Chunk stream IDs 64-65599 can be encoded in the 3-byte version of this field. ID is computed as ((the third byte)\*256 + (the second byte) + 64).

<figure><pre>
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|fmt|     1     |          cs id - 64           |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</pre>
<figcaption>Chunk basic header 3</figcaption>
</figure>

**cs id (6 bits)**: This field contains the chunk stream ID, for values from 2-63. Values 0 and 1 are used to indicate the 2- or 3-byte versions of this field.

**fmt (2 bits)**: This field identifies one of four format used by the ’chunk message header’. The ’chunk message header’ for each of the chunk types is explained in the next section.

**cs id - 64 (8 or 16 bits)**: This field contains the chunk stream ID minus 64. For example, ID 365 would be represented by a 1 in cs id, and a 16-bit 301 here.

Chunk stream IDs with values 64-319 could be represented by either the 2-byte or 3-byte form of the header.


##### 5.3.1.2. Chunk Message Header

There are four different formats for the chunk message header, selected by the "fmt" field in the chunk basic header.

An implementation SHOULD use the most compact representation possible for each chunk message header.


###### 5.3.1.2.1.	Type 0

Type 0 chunk headers are 11 bytes long. This type MUST be used at the start of a chunk stream, and whenever the stream timestamp goes backward (e.g., because of a backward seek).

<figure><pre>
0                   1                   2                   3
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</pre>
<figcaption>Chunk Message Header - Type 0</figcaption>
</figure>

***timestamp (3 bytes)***: For a type-0 chunk, the absolute timestamp of the message is sent here. If the timestamp is greater than or equal to 16777215 (hexadecimal 0xFFFFFF), this field MUST be 16777215, indicating the presence of the Extended Timestamp field to encode the full 32 bit timestamp. Otherwise, this field SHOULD be the entire timestamp.


###### 5.3.1.2.2. Type 1
Type 1 chunk headers are 7 bytes long. The message stream ID is not included; this chunk takes the same stream ID as the preceding chunk. Streams with variable-sized messages (for example, many video formats) SHOULD use this format for the first chunk of each new message after the first.

<figure><pre>
0                   1                   2                   3

</pre>
<figcaption>Chunk Message Header - Type 1</figcaption>
</figure>


###### 5.3.1.2.3. Type 2

Type 2 chunk headers are 3 bytes long. Neither the stream ID nor the message length is included; this chunk has the same stream ID and message length as the preceding chunk. Streams with constant-sized messages (for example, some audio and data formats) SHOULD use this format for the first chunk of each message after the first.

<figure><pre>

###### 5.3.1.2.4. Type 3


Type 3 chunks have no message header. The stream ID, message length and timestamp delta fields are not present; chunks of this type take values from the preceding chunk for the same Chunk Stream ID. When a single message is split into chunks, all chunks of a message except the first one SHOULD use this type. Refer to Example 2 (Section 5.3.2.2). A stream consisting of messages of exactly the same size, stream ID and spacing in time SHOULD use this type for all chunks after a chunk of Type 2. Refer to Example 1 (Section 5.3.2.1). If the delta between the first message and the second message is same as the timestamp of the first message, then a chunk of Type 3 could immediately follow the chunk of Type 0 as there is no need for a chunk of Type 2 to register the delta. If a Type 3 chunk follows a Type 0 chunk, then the timestamp delta for this Type 3 chunk is the same as the timestamp of the Type 0 chunk.

###### 5.3.1.2.5. Common Header Fields

Description of each field in the chunk message header:

**timestamp delta (3 bytes)**: For a type-1 or type-2 chunk, the difference between the previous chunk’s timestamp and the current chunk’s timestamp is sent here. If the delta is greater than or equal to 16777215 (hexadecimal 0xFFFFFF), this field MUST be 16777215, indicating the presence of the Extended Timestamp field to encode the full 32 bit delta. Otherwise, this field SHOULD be the actual delta.

**message length (3 bytes)**: For a type-0 or type-1 chunk, the length of the message is sent here. Note that this is generally not the same as the length of the chunk payload. The chunk payload length is the maximum chunk size for all but the last chunk, and the remainder (which may be the entire length, for small messages) for the last chunk.

**message type id (1 byte)**: For a type-0 or type-1 chunk, type of the message is sent here.

**message stream id (4 bytes)**: For a type-0 chunk, the message stream ID is stored. Message stream ID is stored in little-endian format. Typically, all messages in the same chunk stream will come from the same message stream. While it is possible to multiplex separate message streams into the same chunk stream, this defeats the benefits of the header compression. However, if one message stream is closed and another one subsequently opened, there is no reason an existing chunk stream cannot be reused by sending a new type-0 chunk.


##### 5.3.1.3. Extended Timestamp

The Extended Timestamp field is used to encode timestamps or timestamp deltas that are greater than 16777215 (0xFFFFFF); that is, for timestamps or timestamp deltas that don’t fit in the 24 bit fields of Type 0, 1, or 2 chunks. This field encodes the complete 32-bit timestamp or timestamp delta. The presence of this field is indicated by setting the timestamp field of a Type 0 chunk, or the timestamp delta field of a Type 1 or 2 chunk, to 16777215 (0xFFFFFF). This field is present in Type 3 chunks when the most recent Type 0, 1, or 2 chunk for the same chunk stream ID indicated the presence of an extended timestamp field.

<figcaption>Format of each of the chunks</figcaption>
</figure>

The header data of chunk 1 specifies that the overall message is 307 bytes.

Notice from the two examples, that chunk type 3 can be used in two different ways. The first is to specify the continuation of a message. The second is to specify the beginning of a new message whose header can be derived from the existing state data.


### 5.4. Protocol Control Messages

RTMP Chunk Stream uses message type IDs 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 for protocol control messages. These messages contain information needed by the RTMP Chunk Stream protocol.

These protocol control messages MUST have message stream ID 0 (known as the control stream) and be sent in chunk stream ID 2. Protocol control messages take effect as soon as they are received; their timestamps are ignored.


#### 5.4.1.	Set Chunk Size (1)

Protocol control message 1, Set Chunk Size, is used to notify the peer of a new maximum chunk size.

The maximum chunk size defaults to 128 bytes, but the client or the server can change this value, and updates its peer using this message. For example, suppose a client wants to send 131 bytes of audio data and the chunk size is 128. In this case, the client can send this message to the server to notify it that the chunk size is now 131 bytes. The client can then send the audio data in a single chunk.

The maximum chunk size SHOULD be at least 128 bytes, and MUST be at least 1 byte. The maximum chunk size is maintained independently for each direction.

<figure><pre>

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</pre>
<figcaption>Payload for the ‘Set Chunk Size’ protocol message</figcaption>
</figure>

**0**: This bit MUST be zero.

**chunk size (31 bits)**: This field holds the new maximum chunk size, in bytes, which will be used for all of the sender’s subsequent chunks until further notice. Valid sizes are 1 to 2147483647 (0x7FFFFFFF) inclusive; however, all sizes greater than 16777215 (0xFFFFFF) are equivalent since no chunk is larger than one message, and no message is larger than 16777215 bytes.


#### 5.4.2.	Abort Message (2)

Protocol control message 2, Abort Message, is used to notify the peer if it is waiting for chunks to complete a message, then to discard the partially received message over a chunk stream. The peer receives the chunk stream ID as this protocol message’s payload. An application may send this message when closing in order to indicate that further processing of the messages is not required.

**chunk stream ID (32 bits)**: This field holds the chunk stream ID, whose current message is to be discarded.


#### 5.4.3.	Acknowledgement (3)

The client or the server MUST send an acknowledgment to the peer after receiving bytes equal to the window size. The window size is the maximum number of bytes that the sender sends without receiving acknowledgment from the receiver. This message specifies the sequence number, which is the number of the bytes received so far.

<figure><pre>

#### 5.4.4.	Window Acknowledgement Size (5)

The client or the server sends this message to inform the peer of the window size to use between sending acknowledgments. The sender expects acknowledgment from its peer after the sender sends window size bytes. The receiving peer MUST send an Acknowledgement (Section 5.4.3) after receiving the indicated number of bytes since the last Acknowledgement was sent, or from the beginning of the session if no Acknowledgement has yet been sent.

#### 5.4.5.	Set Peer Bandwidth (6)

The client or the server sends this message to limit the output bandwidth of its peer. The peer receiving this message limits its output bandwidth by limiting the amount of sent but unacknowledged data to the window size indicated in this message. The peer receiving this message SHOULD respond with a Window Acknowledgement Size message if the window size is different from the last one sent to the sender of this message.

<figure><pre>
 0                   1                   2                   3

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</pre>
<figcaption>Payload for the ‘Set Peer Bandwidth’ protocol message</figcaption>
</figure>

The Limit Type is one of the following values:

**0 - Hard**: The peer SHOULD limit its output bandwidth to the indicated window size.

**1 - Soft**: The peer SHOULD limit its output bandwidth to the the window indicated in this message or the limit already in effect, whichever is smaller.

**2 - Dynamic**: If the previous Limit Type was Hard, treat this message as though it was marked Hard, otherwise ignore this message.


## 6. RTMP Message Formats

The section specifies the format of RTMP messages that are transferred between entities on a network using a lower level transport layer, such as RTMP Chunk Stream.

While RTMP was designed to work with the RTMP Chunk Stream, it can send the messages using any other transport protocol. RTMP Chunk Stream and RTMP together are suitable for a wide variety of audio-video applications, from one-to-one and one-to-many live broadcasting to video-on-demand services to interactive conferencing applications.


### 6.1. RTMP Message Format

The server and the client send RTMP messages over the network to communicate with each other. The messages could include audio, video, data, or any other messages.

The RTMP message has two parts, a header and its payload.


#### 6.1.1. Message Header

The message header contains the following:

**Message Type**: One byte field to represent the message type. A range of type IDs (1-6) are reserved for protocol control messages.

**Length**: Three-byte field that represents the size of the payload in bytes. It is set in big-endian format.

**Timestamp**:	Four-byte field that contains a timestamp of the message. The 4 bytes are packed in the big-endian order.

**Message Stream Id**: Three-byte field that identifies the stream of the message. These bytes are set in big-endian format.

<figure><pre>
 0                   1                   2                   3

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</pre>
<figcaption>Message header</figcaption>
</figure>


#### 6.1.2. Message Payload

The other part of the message is the payload, which is the actual data contained in the message. For example, it could be some audio samples or compressed video data. The payload format and interpretation are beyond the scope of this document.


### 6.2. User Control Messages (4)

RTMP uses message type ID 4 for User Control messages. These messages contain information used by the RTMP streaming layer. Protocol messages with IDs 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 are used by the RTMP Chunk Stream protocol (Section 5.4).

User Control messages SHOULD use message stream ID 0 (known as the control stream) and, when sent over RTMP Chunk Stream, be sent on chunk stream ID 2. User Control messages are effective at the point they are received in the stream; their timestamps are ignored.

The client or the server sends this message to notify the peer about the user control events. This message carries Event type and Event data.

<figure><pre>
+------------------------------+-------------------------
|      Event Type (16 bits)    | Event Data
+------------------------------+-------------------------
</pre>
<figcaption>Payload for the ‘User Control’ protocol message</figcaption>
</figure>

The first 2 bytes of the message data are used to identify the Event type.	Event type is followed by Event data.	The size of Event Data field is variable.	However, in cases where the message has to pass through the RTMP Chunk Stream layer, the maximum chunk size (Section 5.4.1) SHOULD be large enough to allow these messages to fit in a single chunk.

Event Types are and their Event Data formats are enumerated in Section 7.1.7.


## 7. RTMP Command Messages

This section describes the different types of messages and commands that are exchanged between the server and the client to communicate with each other.

The different types of messages that are exchanged between the server and the client include audio messages for sending the audio data, video messages for sending video data, data messages for sending any user data, shared object messages, and command messages. Shared object messages provide a general purpose way to manage distributed data among multiple clients and a server. Command messages carry the AMF encoded commands between the client and the server. A client or a server can request Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) over streams that are communicated using the command messages to the peer.


### 7.1.	Types of Messages

The server and the client send messages over the network to communicate with each other. The messages can be of any type which includes audio messages, video messages, command messages, shared object messages, data messages, and user control messages.


#### 7.1.1.	Command Message (20, 17)

Command messages carry the AMF-encoded commands between the client and the server. These messages have been assigned message type value of 20 for AMF0 encoding and message type value of 17 for AMF3 encoding. These messages are sent to perform some operations like connect, createStream, publish, play, pause on the peer. Command messages like onstatus, result etc. are used to inform the sender about the status of the requested commands. A command message consists of command name, transaction ID, and command object that contains related parameters. A client or a server can request Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) over streams that are communicated using the command messages to the peer.


#### 7.1.2.	Data Message (18, 15)

The client or the server sends this message to send Metadata or any user data to the peer. Metadata includes details about the data(audio, video etc.) like creation time, duration, theme and so on. These messages have been assigned message type value of 18 for AMF0 and message type value of 15 for AMF3.


#### 7.1.3.	Shared Object Message (19, 16)

A shared object is a Flash object (a collection of name value pairs) that are in synchronization across multiple clients, instances, and so on. The message types 19 for AMF0 and 16 for AMF3 are reserved for shared object events. Each message can contain multiple events.

<figure><pre>

</figure>



The following event types are supported:

| Event | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| Use (=1) | The client sends this event to inform the server about the creation of a named shared object. |
| Release (=2) | The client sends this event to the server when the shared object is deleted on the client side.  |
| Request Change (=3) | The client sends this event to request that the change the value associated with a named parameter of the shared object. |
| Change (=4)  | The server sends this event to notify all clients, except the client originating the request, of a change in the value of a named parameter. |
| Success (=5)  | The server sends this event to the requesting client in response to RequestChange event if the request is accepted. |
| SendMessage (=6) | The client sends this event to the server to broadcast a message. On receiving this event, the server broadcasts a message to all the clients, including the sender. |
| Status (=7) | The server sends this event to notify clients about error conditions. |
| Clear (=8) | The server sends this event to the client to clear a shared object. The server also sends this event in response to Use event that the client sends on connect. |
| Remove (=9) | The server sends this event to have the client delete a slot. |
| Request Remove (=10) | The client sends this event to have the client delete a slot.  |
| Use Success (=11) | The server sends this event to the client on a successful connection. |



#### 7.1.4.	Audio Message (8)

The client or the server sends this message to send audio data to the peer. The message type value of 8 is reserved for audio messages.


#### 7.1.5.	Video Message (9)

The client or the server sends this message to send video data to the peer. The message type value of 9 is reserved for video messages.


#### 7.1.6.	Aggregate Message (22)

An aggregate message is a single message that contains a series of RTMP sub-messages using the format described in Section 6.1. Message type 22 is used for aggregate messages.

<figcaption>The Aggregate Message body format</figcaption>
</figure>

The message stream ID of the aggregate message overrides the message stream IDs of the sub-messages inside the aggregate.

The difference between the timestamps of the aggregate message and the first sub-message is the offset used to renormalize the timestamps of the sub-messages to the stream timescale. The offset is added to each sub-message’s timestamp to arrive at the normalized stream time. The timestamp of the first sub-message SHOULD be the same as the timestamp of the aggregate message, so the offset SHOULD be zero.

The back pointer contains the size of the previous message including its header. It is included to match the format of FLV file and is used for backward seek.

Using aggregate messages has several performance benefits:

- The chunk stream can send at most a single complete message within a chunk. Therefore, increasing the chunk size and using the aggregate message reduces the number of chunks sent.
- The sub-messages can be stored contiguously in memory. It is more efficient when making system calls to send the data on the network.


#### 7.1.7.	User Control Message Events

The client or the server sends this message to notify the peer about the user control events. For information about the message format, see Section 6.2.

The following user control event types are supported:

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Stream Begin (=0) | The server sends this event to notify the client that a stream has become functional and can be used for communication. By default, this event is sent on ID 0 after the application connect command is successfully received from the client. The event data is 4-byte and represents the stream ID of the stream that became functional. |
| Stream EOF (=1) | The server sends this event to notify the client that the playback of data is over as requested on this stream. No more data is sent without issuing additional commands. The client discards the messages received for the stream. The 4 bytes of event data represent the ID of the stream on which playback has ended. |
| StreamDry (=2) | The server sends this event to notify the client that there is no more data on the stream. If the server does not detect any message for a time period, it can notify the subscribed clients that the stream is dry. The 4 bytes of event data represent the stream ID of the dry stream. |
| SetBuffer Length (=3) | The client sends this event to inform the server of the buffer size (in milliseconds) that is used to buffer any data coming over a stream. This event is sent before the server starts processing the stream. The first 4 bytes of the event data represent the stream ID and the next 4 bytes represent the buffer length, in milliseconds. |
| StreamIs Recorded (=4) | The server sends this event to notify the client that the stream is a recorded stream. The 4 bytes event data represent the stream ID of the recorded stream. |
| PingRequest (=6) | The server sends this event to test whether the client is reachable. Event data is a 4-byte timestamp, representing the local server time when the server dispatched the command. The client responds with PingResponse on receiving MsgPingRequest. |
| PingResponse (=7) | The client sends this event to the server in response to the ping request. The event data is a 4-byte timestamp, which was received with the PingRequest request. |


### 7.2.	Types of Commands

The client and the server exchange commands which are AMF encoded. The sender sends a command message that consists of command name, transaction ID, and command object that contains related parameters. For example, the connect command contains ’app’ parameter, which tells the server application name the client is connected to. The receiver processes the command and sends back the response with the same transaction ID. The response string is either \_result, \_error, or a method name, for example, verifyClient or contactExternalServer.

A command string of \_result or \_error signals a response. The transaction ID indicates the outstanding command to which the response refers. It is identical to the tag in IMAP and many other protocols. The method name in the command string indicates that the sender is trying to run a method on the receiver end.

The following class objects are used to send various commands:

**NetConnection**: An object that is a higher-level representation of connection between the server and the client.

**NetStream**: An object that represents the channel over which audio streams, video streams and other related data are sent. We also send commands like play, pause etc. which control the flow of the data.


#### 7.2.1.	NetConnection Commands

The NetConnection manages a two-way connection between a client application and the server. In addition, it provides support for asynchronous remote method calls.

The following commands can be sent on the NetConnection:

- connect
- call
- close
- createStream


##### 7.2.1.1.	connect

The client sends the connect command to the server to request connection to a server application instance.

The command structure from the client to the server is as follows:

<figure><pre>

<figcaption>Message flow in the connect command</figcaption>
</figure>

The message flow during the execution of the command is:

1. Client sends the connect command to the server to request to connect with the server application instance.
2. After receiving the connect command, the server sends the protocol message ’Window Acknowledgement Size’ to the client. The server also connects to the application mentioned in the connect command.
3. The server sends the protocol message ’Set Peer Bandwidth’ to the client.
4. The client sends the protocol message ’Window Acknowledgement Size’ to the server after processing the protocol message ’Set Peer Bandwidth’.
5. The server sends an another protocol message of type User Control Message(StreamBegin) to the client.
6. The server sends the result command message informing the client of the connection status (success/fail). The command specifies the transaction ID (always equal to 1 for the connect command). The message also specifies the properties, such as Flash Media Server version (string). In addition it specifies other connection response related information like level (string), code (string), description (string), object encoding (number), etc.


##### 7.2.1.2.	Call

The call method of the NetConnection object runs remote procedure calls (RPC) at the receiving end. The called RPC name is passed as a parameter to the call command.

The command structure from the sender to the receiver is as follows:

<figure><pre>
+--------------+----------+----------------------------------------+
|Field Name    |   Type   |             Description                |

 +------------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre></figure>

##### 7.2.1.3.	createStream

The client sends this command to the server to create a logical channel for message communication The publishing of audio, video, and metadata is carried out over stream channel created using the createStream command.

NetConnection is the default communication channel, which has a stream ID 0. Protocol and a few command messages, including createStream, use the default communication channel.

The command structure from the client to the server is as follows:

<figure><pre>

#### 7.2.2.	NetStream Commands

The NetStream defines the channel through which the streaming audio, video, and data messages can flow over the NetConnection that connects the client to the server. A NetConnection object can support multiple NetStreams for multiple data streams.

The following commands can be sent on the NetStream by the client to the server:


- play
- play2
- deleteStream
- closeStream
- receiveAudio
- receiveVideo
- publish
- seek
- pause

The server sends NetStream status updates to the client using the "onStatus" command:

##### 7.2.2.1.	play

The client sends this command to the server to play a stream. A playlist can also be created using this command multiple times.

If you want to create a dynamic playlist that switches among different live or recorded streams, call play more than once and pass false for reset each time. Conversely, if you want to play the specified stream immediately, clearing any other streams that are queued for play, pass true for reset.

The command structure from the client to the server is as follows:

<figure><pre>
+--------------+----------+-----------------------------------------+
| Field Name   |   Type   |             Description                 |
+--------------+----------+-----------------------------------------+
| Command Name |  String  | Name of the command. Set to "play".     |
+--------------+----------+-----------------------------------------+
| Transaction  |  Number  | Transaction ID set to 0.                |
| ID           |          |                                         |
+--------------+----------+-----------------------------------------+
| Command      |   Null   | Command information does not exist.     |
| Object       |          | Set to null type.                       |
+--------------+----------+-----------------------------------------+
| Stream Name  |  String  | Name of the stream to play.             |
|              |          | To play video (FLV) files, specify the  |
|              |          | name of the stream without a file       |
|              |          | extension (for example, "sample"). To   |
|              |          | play back MP3 or ID3 tags, you must     |
|              |          | precede the stream name with mp3:       |
|              |          | (for example, "mp3:sample"). To play    |
|              |          | H.264/AAC files, you must precede the   |
|              |          | stream name with mp4: and specify the   |
|              |          | file extension. For example, to play the|
|              |          | file sample.m4v, specify                |
|              |          | "mp4:sample.m4v".                       |
|              |          |                                         |
+--------------+----------+-----------------------------------------+
| Start        |  Number  | An optional parameter that specifies    |
|              |          | the start time in seconds. The default  |
|              |          | value is -2, which means the subscriber |
|              |          | first tries to play the live stream     |
|              |          | specified in the Stream Name field. If a|
|              |          | live stream of that name is not found,  |
|              |          | it plays the recorded stream of the same|
|              |          | name. If there is no recorded stream    |
|              |          | with that name, the subscriber waits for|
|              |          | a new live stream with that name and    |
|              |          | plays it when available. If you pass -1 |
|              |          | in the Start field, only the live stream|
|              |          | specified in the Stream Name field is   |
|              |          | played. If you pass 0 or a positive     |
|              |          | number in the Start field, a recorded   |
|              |          | stream specified in the Stream Name     |
|              |          | field is played beginning from the time |
|              |          | specified in the Start field. If no     |
|              |          | recorded stream is found, the next item |
|              |          | in the playlist is played.              |
+--------------+----------+-----------------------------------------+
| Duration     |  Number  | An optional parameter that specifies the|
|              |          | duration of playback in seconds. The    |
|              |          | default value is -1. The -1 value means |
|              |          | a live stream is played until it is no  |
|              |          | longer available or a recorded stream is|
|              |          | played until it ends. If you pass 0, it |
|              |          | plays the single frame since the time   |
|              |          | specified in the Start field from the   |
|              |          | beginning of a recorded stream. It is   |
|              |          | assumed that the value specified in     |
|              |          | the Start field is equal to or greater  |
|              |          | than 0. If you pass a positive number,  |
|              |          | it plays a live stream for              |
|              |          | the time period specified in the        |
|              |          | Duration field. After that it becomes   |
|              |          | available or plays a recorded stream    |
|              |          | for the time specified in the Duration  |
|              |          | field. (If a stream ends before the     |
|              |          | time specified in the Duration field,   |
|              |          | playback ends when the stream ends.)    |
|              |          | If you pass a negative number other     |
|              |          | than -1 in the Duration field, it       |
|              |          | interprets the value as if it were -1.  |
+--------------+----------+-----------------------------------------+
| Reset        | Boolean  | An optional Boolean value or number     |
|              |          | that specifies whether to flush any     |
|              |          | previous playlist.                      |

<figcaption>Message flow in the play command</figcaption>
</figure>

The message flow during the execution of the command is:

1. The client sends the play command after receiving result of the createStream command as success from the server.
2. On receiving the play command, the server sends a protocol message to set the chunk size.
3. The server sends another protocol message (user control) specifying the event ’StreamIsRecorded’ and the stream ID in that message. The message carries the event type in the first 2 bytes and the stream ID in the last 4 bytes.
1. The server sends another protocol message (user control) specifying the event ’StreamBegin’, to indicate beginning of the streaming to the client.
2. The server sends an onStatus command messages NetStream.Play.Start & NetStream.Play.Reset if the play command sent by the client is successful. NetStream.Play.Reset is sent by the server only if the play command sent by the client has set the reset flag. If the stream to be played is not found, the Server sends the onStatus message NetStream.Play.StreamNotFound.

After this, the server sends audio and video data, which the client plays.


##### 7.2.2.2.	play2

Unlike the play command, play2 can switch to a different bit rate stream without changing the timeline of the content played. The server maintains multiple files for all supported bitrates that the client can request in play2.

The command structure from the client to the server is as follows:

<figure><pre>

|              |          | Client when stream was paused. When the|
|              |          | playback is resumed, the server will   |
|              |          | only send messages with timestamps     |
|              |          | greater than this value.               |
+--------------+----------+----------------------------------------+
</pre></figure>

The server sends a status message NetStream.Pause.Notify when the stream is paused. NetStream.Unpause.Notify is sent when a stream in un-paused. In failure, it returns an \_error message.


### 7.3. Message Exchange Examples

Here are a few examples to explain message exchange using RTMP.
